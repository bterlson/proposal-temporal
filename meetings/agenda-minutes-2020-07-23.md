Attendees:

* Shane Carr (SFC)

* Jason Williams (JWS)

* Justin Grant (JGT)

Agenda:

* Translate the survey in order to get more responses from non-Gregorian-calendar developers? (idea from Yulia)

    * SFC: It might be good to just ask people we know.

    * JGT: I assume Japanese would be good. There’s a large Arabic software development community, but not sure how many aren’t also fluent in English.

    * SFC: Even if fluent, good to translate to drive interest.

    * JWS: So 1. Do we have resources to do it and 2. Does it have value?

    * JWS: We could make an issue for this?

    * Jason to make issue for translations of the survey

* How to approach IETF calext/calconnect working group?

    * For [#702](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/702) RFC 5545 vs DST questions for IETF calendar standards ("calext") group

    * JGT: How is CalConnect related to calext ([https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/calext/email/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/calext/email/))

    * SFC: CalConnect is iCal i'm not as familiar with calext.

    * JGT: Who will answer my Qs about the RFC 5545 spec?

    * JGT: Will reach out to CalConnect
