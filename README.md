## Status

This proposal is currently stage 1

## Overview / Motivation

Date has been a long time pain point in ECMAScript.
This proposes `temporal`, a built in module that brings a modern date time API to the ECMAScript language.
For a detailed breakdown of motivations see:
[Fixing JavaScript Date](https://maggiepint.com/2017/04/09/fixing-javascript-date-getting-started/)

### Principles:

- All temporal APIs are non-mutating.  All temporal objects are effectively immutable.
- All date values are based on the [Proleptic Gregorian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar).  Other calendar systems are out-of-scope for this proposal.  However, we will consider how future APIs may interact with this one such that extending it to support other calendars may be possible in a future proposal.
- All time-of-day values are based on a standard 24-hour clock.
- [Leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) are not represented.

# Overview of Standard Objects in the `temporal` module

### Objects representing Civil Time

Object name     | Description                                                         | Example
----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------
`CivilDate`     | A date without any time or time zone reference.                     | `2017-12-31`
`CivilTime`     | A time-of-day without any date or time zone reference.              | `17:00:00`
`CivilDateTime` | A date and a time without any time zone reference.                  | `2017-12-31T12:00:00`

### Objects representing Absolute Time

Object name     | Description                                                         | Example
----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------
`Instant`       | A point on the universal timeline, typically represented in UTC.    | `2017-12-31T00:00:00Z`
`ZonedInstant`  | A point on the universal timeline, with an associated time zone.    | `2017‑12‑31T09:00:00+09:00[Asia/Tokyo]`

Note that the time zone of a `ZonedInstant` can be any of:

- Coordinated Universal Time, indicated by the string `'UTC'`
- The system local time zone, indicated by the string `'SYSTEM'`
- A fixed offset from UTC, indicated by a string in `'±HH:MM'` or `'±HHMM'` format
- A `Zone` or `Link` name from the [IANA time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones),
  as also listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

Because a fixed offset is supported, there is no need for a separate `OffsetDateTime` type.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Scenario-Based Examples

### Convert a time in one time zone to a time at the same instant in another time zone.

```js
// Temporal
let dateTimeInChicago = new CivilDateTime(2000, 12, 31, 23, 59)
let instantInChicago = dateTimeInChicago.withZone('America/Chicago');
let instantInSydney = new ZonedInstant(instantInChicago.instant, 'Australia/Sydney')
let dateTimeInSydney = instantInSydney.toCivilDateTime()
dateTimeInChicago.toString() // 2000-12-31T23:59:00.000000000
dateTimeInSydney.toString()  // 2001-01-01T16:59:00.000000000

// Date
// A time zone is not supported, so an offset must be used instead.
// Whatever provides the offset needs to know when to provide -05:00 vs -06:00 for Chicago.
let timestampInChicago = Date.parse("2000-12-31T23:59:00-06:00")
let dateInLocalTimeZone = new Date(timestampInChicago)
let formatterInSydney = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { timeZone: 'Australia/Sydney', year: 'numeric', month: 'numeric', day: 'numeric', hour: 'numeric', minute: 'numeric', second: 'numeric' }
let formatterInChicago = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { timeZone: 'America/Chicago', year: 'numeric', month: 'numeric', day: 'numeric', hour: 'numeric', minute: 'numeric', second: 'numeric' }))
dateInLocalTimeZone.toISOString()              // 2001-01-01T05:59:00.000Z
formatterInSydney.format(dateInLocalTimeZone)  // 1/1/2001, 4:59:00 PM
formatterInChicago.format(dateInLocalTimeZone) // 12/31/2000, 11:59:00 PM

// Performing calendar operations such as finding the start of month
dateTimeInChicago.with({ day: 1 }).toString() // 2000-12-01T23:59:00.000000000
dateTimeInSydney.with({ day: 1 }).toString()  // 2001-01-01T16:59:00.000000000
dateInLocalTimeZone.setDate(1)
dateInLocalTimeZone.toISOString()             // dependent on local time zone
// A Date object is unable to perform calendar operations in time zones other than local time or UTC.

# Technical Design Decision Record

As part of creating/improving the *temporal* proposal, a discussions took place involving [@maggiepint](https://twitter.com/maggiepint), [@RedSquirrelious](https://twitter.com/RedSquirrelious), [@bterlson](https://twitter.com/bterlson) and  [@pipobscure](https://twitter.com/pipobscure) as well as at times [@littledan](https://twitter.com/littledan) and others. These are the conclusions we arrived at. This is the summary of my recollections of the reasoning behind these decisions.

## Omit `toDate()` methods

We did not want to tie the *temporal* proposals to the existing `Date` built-in objects. The creating an explicit dependency makes future evolution of the standards harder.

For that reason we omitted the `toDate()` methods from the proposal. This is simply a shortcut for `new Date(instant.milliseconds)` to begin with, so there is very little benefit to that tie.

## Naming `fromMilliseconds()` rather than `fromDate()` method

In the same vein as omitting `toDate()` we also decided to name the method to create an Instant from a `Date` as `fromMilliseconds()` rather than `fromDate()`. For one thing, the name `fromMilliseconds()` is actually more reflective of what the method is supposed to do as it is supposed to accept a numeric argument representing the *milliseconds since epoch* as well.

The semantics of the method will be:

1. _ms_ is the value of `ToNumber(argument)`
1. _ns_ is set to `0`
1. a new instant is created with the *value of* `(ms * 1e6) + ns`

In this logic, the first step would convert a `Date` object to its numeric value via `Date.prototype.valueOf()` which is the *milliseconds since epoch*. As such even though the methods was renamed it can still function as `fromDate()` without making an explicit tie to the build-in `Date` object.

## Naming method `fromString()` rather than `parse()`

There has been long lived discussions on the inconsistencies in the implementations of `Date.parse()`. The aim of naming `fromString()` as that rather than `parse()` was to avoid these. `fromString()` should mirror the behaviour of `toString()` rather than implementing an actual parse. The only functionality `fromString()` should support is parsing the *strings* produced by `toString()` and nothing more.

This is narrowed down to an exceedingly narrow set of formats by explicitly and tightly specifying the relevant `toString()` operations.

The purpose of `fromString()` and the reason we felt we still wanted it as part of the api is that we wanted to allow round-tripping like `Instant.fromString(instant.toString())` which allows for easier serialisation.

**Examples**

`Instant.prototype.toString()` always outputs **&lt;year>-&lt;month>-&lt;day>T&lt;hours>:&lt;minutes>:&lt;seconds>.&lt;nanoseconds>Z**

`ZonedInstant.prototype.toString` always outputs **&lt;year>-&lt;month>-&lt;day>T&lt;hours>:&lt;minutes>:&lt;seconds>.&lt;nanoseconds>[Z|&lt;offset>]**

Other formats of parts will not be output, so the `fromString()` methods can be extremely restrictive.

### ZonedInstant.prototype.timezone will be the offset rather than the IANA name

The offset at a point in time is unique an clear. It can also be parsed back allowing for serialisation as described above.

In contrast the *IANA Zones* are unclear and are hard to parse back requiring a full timezone database. In order to keep the proposal interoperable with IoT and other low-spec scenarios, requiring full *IANA* support seemed contraindicated.

At the same time we felt it's critical to allow for fully supporting *IANA Zones* in the `ZonedInstant` constructor as well as the `withZone()` methods.

## Omit `.valueOf()` and have `.value` on `Instant` and `ZonedInstant`

`.valueOf()` is a special kind of method and has a lot of implications in terms of casting. See [Issue #74](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/74) for the full discussion. Due to all of that returning a `BigInt` from that is counter productive and there be dragons if we go there. Also there is little value in having `.valueOf()`.

However we doo need a way to get the nanoseconds that have elapsed since the epoch rather than just the constituent parts. For that reason we suggest having the `.value` property that returns a `BigInt` representing the nanoseconds since the epoch.

## `toString()` should in fact return the ISO-String

Again [Issue #74](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/74) has the full discussion. The agreement was that the ISO-String seems to be the right thig to return. Something of the shape *[object Type]* is insufficient since it gives no insight into the value. Something like *[object Type ISO-String]* is unprecendented and to be avoided since it would be unlikely to ever get consensus. Most other things in JS return a string-version of the value, so the ISO-String seems to be the right thing.

## `.toJSON()` should return the ISO representation (similar to `Date`)

`JSON.stringify()` is a very common need. The standard way to deal with this is to do what `Date` does and stringify to some standardized string-representation. Parsing can be done by implementing a reviver passed to `JSON.parse()`.

**Example 1:**

```
const json = '{"d":"2018-08-03T05:18:47.635000000-07:00"}';
const parsed = JSON.parse(json, (key, value)=>{
  try {
    return ZonedInstant.fromString(value);
  } catch(e) {
    console.error(e);
    return value;
  }
});
```

**Example 2:**

```
const json = '{"d":"2018-08-03T05:18:47.635000000Z"}';
const parsed = JSON.parse(json, (key, value)=>{
  try {
    return Instant.fromString(value);
  } catch(e) {
    console.error(e);
    return value;
  }
});
```

## Omit `.now()` and similar access to the current moment

See [Issue #73](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/73) for the full discussion.

There are two main issues with this. For one, it makes getting higher resolution things harder in future, and it also creates security problems since it makes the outside environment available in the VM.

Since there is an easy way to get the current date/time already (`Instant.fromMilliseconds(Date.now())`) this convenience seemed ill-advised given the issues it would raise.

## Omit `.plus()` from `Instant` (and potentially from `ZonedInstant`)

See [Issue #68](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/68) for the full discussion.

It turns out that adding to an `Instant` without a clear timezone is ambiguous.

> Assume the instant 2020-02-29T16:00:00.000000000Z
>
> In Britain the calculation instant.plus({ month: 1 }) would result in 2020-03-29T16:00:00.000000000Z
>
> In Sydney that is already 2020-03-01T02:00:00.000000000 so the calculation there would have to yield 2020-04-01T02:00:00.000000000 which in turn is actually several days ahead if expressed as an Instant. So it's ambiguous.

While this would be OK for `ZonedInstant` the question now is whether to restrict it to things that innately have a concept of distinct units to add and subtract. This is under discussion especially in the context of supporting different calendars and renaming `CivilXXX` objects as raised in [Issue #79](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/79).
